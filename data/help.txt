FAQ:
    - Why use jbterminal?
    Well jbterminal is more superior to jbtr.net calculator and jbvalues. 
    It has additional features like auto dupe checking, multiple value list support (ui that isnt shitty in my opinion). 
    It's also open source so you can edit the source code to your needs and add features.

    Yes, it's also open source so you can check the code.
